#+title: Exercise on grouping data for time interval graphs

* This program contains function that satisfies following requirements:

1. take in slice of =Transaction= structs
   #+begin_src go
type Transaction struct {
	Value		int
	Timestamp     time.Time
}
   #+end_src
2. group them by truncating timestamp down to closest 'hour', 'day', 'week', 'month'
3. keeps latest transaction

* To use the program
** if you have go installed:
#+begin_src bash
go build
./graph-grouping-exercise test-data/example-transactions-1.json hour
#+end_src

call the executable with path to input data json and interval

** or using nix to get dependencies locked in flake.lock
#+begin_src bash
nix develop
go build
./graph-grouping-exercise test-data/example-transactions-1.json hour
#+end_src

** or using the =GroupTransactions= function directly from code
by passing in your data structures
